            Cubeâ€™s Traveller is a cooperative game where you are supposed to work together in an environment which is visually stunning, but challenges your world view. In this game, one player is controlling the world, which is a cube, and the other player controls a character on the cube. Our goal is to create a new interactive experience without the often disappointing experiences of VR/AR, and instead focus on different interaction technologies. Additionally, a major goal of our game is to make it visually beautiful to help players immerse themselves into the game world. We thought that previous projects have lacked the visual fidelity we want to achieve.

            The motivation for a cooperative game was simple, we think that playing games with a friend is really fun, therefore it was very obvious to select it as the main project focus. With the limited time and ambitious graphical goals, we limited ourselves to a simple, yet effective, art style where models and textures are basic but lighting is complex and beautiful. We believe that this helped us stand out from the rest and create a unique experience.
